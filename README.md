# Communications Code of Conduct (CCOC)

> __This CCoC is no longer maintained here. It has moved to the [PublicisSapient org defaults repo](https://github.com/PublicisSapient/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)__

This document originates from work led by Eiko Kawano [over here](https://ps.blog/2019/09/24/community-code-of-conduct-psx/) together with a host of Publicis Sapient team members. We use it as a set of ground rules for when we use electronic forums for connecting with each other — and they are based in the five core values of Publicis Sapient.

**The Short Version: Be a Good Human.** 

* **We think before we type.** We avoid language (and actions) that are discriminatory, hurtful and that exclude others. We remember that there are human beings on the other end of our words.  
* **We welcome diversity** in the form of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, all forms of disability and ability, appearance, race, ethnicity, religion or lack thereof, socioeconomic background, educational background, military and veteran status, and location.
* **We are harassment-free.** We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to discriminatory language or jokes, personal insults, threats of violence and unwelcome sexual attention.

**The Less Short Version: Live Our Values.** 

Our Communications Code of Conduct is informed by our Core Values. We believe in:  

# 1. Inclusive Collaboration  

_Create space for multiple voices and integrate diverse perspectives to realize shared goals._

* Make this a home for everyone, by using language that includes all genders and gender-orientations.  
* Welcome a variety of opinions, perspectives, social styles and learning styles – the more diverse, the better.  
* Encourage participation from all levels, not just senior people.  
* Add people to the channel – especially if you think they can offer a new point of view. 
* Never make someone feel uncomfortable or threatened. 

# 2. Engaging with Openness 

_Share and seek ideas and dialogue openly to deepen understanding and connection with others._

* Share what you care about – this is a channel where everyone has a voice.  
* Use this channel to create connections and build relationships across the network. 
* Demonstrate empathy for other people, and for their unique situations. Be mindful when engaging in sensitive topics. 
* Make this a space where people can be vulnerable.  
* Never use someone’s vulnerability against them. 

# 3. Partnering for Client Impact 

_Care about our clients’ problems and partner for extraordinary impact and long-term, sustained success._ 

* Our clients often have motivations and goals that aren’t obvious to us. Try to uncover them. 
* When reviewing client work, aim to uncover a deeper understanding of the objectives driving the work. 
* Remember that clients are people too, and that being empathetic towards them in our internal communications will translate externally. 
* When giving feedback on work, encourage outcome-driven thinking. What’s the intended impact of this work? What’s the long-term goal?  
* Put yourself in your client’s shoes and consider their professional aspirations as an important piece of their equation — ask how you can help them. 

# 4. Learning Mindset 

_Find the courage to question what we know, take risks and learn continuously to unlock potential in ourselves and others._ 

* Encourage early drafts, and MVP versions. 
* Make it okay for others to experiment – and to fail. Share both successes and failures, with the goal of learning. 
* Use feedback as a demonstration of support for others.  
* Remember that different people learn differently, and some may need time to digest ideas before responding. 
* Replace judgement with curiosity.  

# 5. Embracing the Future 

_Generate possibilities and use the power of creativity to innovate in ways that matter to people._ 

* Ask, “What if?” and, “How might we?” 
* Use this channel to co-create new ideas. 
* Offer your opinion – even when (especially when) it feels scary to do so. 
* Be playful.  
* Remember: our purpose propels us forward. When we live from a place of purpose, the passion we have for that purpose enables the future. There are others here who likely share a purpose similar to yours; when you find them, look for ways to create a vision for the future.
